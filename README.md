## Daisho - Your own TO-DO manager

### Introduction

[Daisho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daish%C5%8D) in Japanese literally means `big-little`.

It was used to denote the pair of Japanese swords, Katana and Wakizashi worn by the Samurai as a symbol of their social status as well as to serve in war. 


### Why the name `Daisho`?

A Samurai's sword was synonymous to his life, and his integrity. 

Even though the sword was late to enter the Samurai era compared to the bow/arrow, it ended up being a symbol we associate most with the ferocious and loyal Samurai.

As how the sword duo helped the Samurai fight through their obstacles physically and psychologically, 
I hope this TO-DO manager helps the user overcome their ever-growing task list in this fast, busy, and overwhelming life.


### How it works?

As of now, Daisho will have to be started in a terminal where it will wait for tasks to be input.

A normal input will have to have the keyword `add` prior stating the to-do.

The to-do is saved in a YAML formatted file in Daisho's configuration path, ie.. at ~/.config/daisho/to-do.yaml
